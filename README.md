# STABLE MARIAGE PROBLEM

In order to run this application, you must have installed PHP interpreter on you machine. 

This application tested on PHP 7.0.10, the application may work with old versions of PHP but we do not guarantee it.

## HOW TO RUN

First open comman shell and change your current directory to basepath of the application, it depends on where you store it.

For CMD use `cd` command to get into basepath of the application

Then run `php index.php` command to start application, it will ask for enter integer between 1 and 50, when you hit appropriate 
number and then enter, the application will run the Gale & Shapley Algorithm to solve "Stable Marriage Problem"

Thanks.
